# PID Control Study for 1-DoF Manipulator Based on Forward Kinematics

## Overview
In this study, we design a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller for a 1-degree of freedom (DoF) manipulator. The controller is essential for achieving the desired output, which is often challenging due to dynamic changes in the system. By developing a mathematical model of the manipulator, we aim to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the control system, ensuring stable operation in accordance with established requirements.

## Introduction
Robotic manipulators are widely used across various industries, including aerospace, manufacturing, automotive, and medical applications. These systems perform complex tasks in hazardous environments, demonstrating superior speed, accuracy, and durability compared to human workers. The manipulation capabilities are crucial for applications such as welding, painting, assembly, and packaging.

This study emphasizes the importance of understanding robot kinematics and implementing effective control strategies to ensure accurate manipulator movements. By employing PID control, we address key performance metrics such as rise time, settling time, overshoot, and steady-state error, which contribute to the system's overall stability and reliability.
